# CLIDDIT
A Reddit Client in CLI

## Why?

I've been browsing a wee too much reddit in this quarantine, so I've decided to actually turn this mishabit into something productive.
Now we've got CLIDDIT, Cliddit is a CLI Reddit client with no authentication

# How?
This is an excercise to use as few libraries as possible, for now i'll only use sfml and ncurses, sfml is for some neat networking capabilities. It is a very real
possibility that i'll add libcaca to "render" pictures
Reddit has one amazing feature where you can append ".json" to any url and the website will be returned to you in JSON


# May i see?
Yes of course!

I'll have to add some screenshots though, maybe in a later state of the program.


# Contributing
